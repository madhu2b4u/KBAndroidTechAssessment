# KB Android Technical Assessment

# Overview

Welcome to the KiwiBank Tech Assessment!
This project presents a simplified version of our Bank Account Overview screen. Your task is to
enhance its functionality by adding a few features:

# What the App Does Now:

Displays Available Balance: You'll see your current Travel Savings Account balance is displayed. The
value at the moment is just hard-coded.
Transaction History List: The app showcases a list of your past transactions, including the date,
description, and amount.
Date Filter Icon: A filter icon is present in the top app bar, but its functionality is not included
in this initial project.

# Your Task

Implement the following functionalities:

- Calculate Balance: Accurately calculate and display the available balance based on the
  transactions.
- Date Filter: Add a date filter UI element (e.g., date pickers or text fields).
- Filter Transactions: When a filter is applied, update the transaction list to display only
  transactions within the specified date range.
- Update Balance: As transactions are filtered, recalculate and display the filtered balance.
- Reset Filter: Provide a way to reset the filters and view all transactions.

We'll assess your:

Functionality: How well your solution meets the requirements.
Code quality: Your coding style, structure, and maintainability.
Efficiency: The performance of your solution, especially with large datasets.
Problem-solving: Your ability to understand the problem and create a solution.

# Additional Notes

Think of this assessment as a stepping stone within a larger product! Your goal is to showcase your
production-level coding practices while demonstrating problem-solving abilities.

However, We recommend allocating no more than 4 hours for this assessment. If you find yourself
exceeding this time, feel free to discuss your progress and any challenges you've encountered during
the interview.

Feel free to:

Leverage appropriate technologies: Incorporate libraries or frameworks that enhance your solution.
Customize your approach: Modify the code structure/data structure or use different techniques to
align with your preferred style or problem-solving strategies.

We look forward to discussing your solution and learning more about your skills in the
next round of interviews.

Good luck!
